Emergency alert system - Provide care and instructions during and after an emergency.

This is a long-term project. I created a repository because I would likely forget the idea.

I don't know who would be interested in the project. Probably schools, companies and maybe even governmental organizations. The project should be scalable for every kind of organization.

## Project goals
* When an emergency is detected, initiate an alert ASAP
* Use apps to show the alerts on computers and mobile devices (maybe automatically lock the computers to avoid intruder access?)
* Quickly deliver messages through text messages (over SMS, WhatsApp, Signal etc.)
* Make use of Internet-enabled devices like gas valves and take measures to minimize the impact
* Require as little prior training as possible. Make sure integrating and using the software is easy for the user.
* Automatically inform law enforcement and make sure help is in the way

## Even more goals but these are for specific users
* Override TV and radio streams
* Presidential alert
* Panic buttons
* Audible alerts (text-to-speech)
